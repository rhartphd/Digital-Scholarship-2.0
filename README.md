# Digital Justice for All: Critical Inquiry Tools for Under-Resourced Humanists in the LLM Era

This repository hosts the open-source analytics platform, documentation, and teaching materials developed as part of the **ACLS Digital Justice Development Grant** project at **Texas Southern University**.

## Overview
Digital Scholarship 2.0 advances social justice in digital humanities by enabling scholars—especially at under-resourced institutions—to perform advanced data analysis, visualization, and text mining **without requiring programming expertise**.  
The project combines three deliverables:
1. **An open-source Python analytics platform**
2. **A freely available, out-of-the-box Critical Research Toolkit**
3. **Open-access course materials and training modules** for *Digital Scholarship 2.0*.
